# Log Analyser Application

This document outlines the current features of the Log Analyser application and potential future enhancements.

## Current Features (MVP)

- **Log Analysis with Generative AI:** The application uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze log data and provide summaries and insights.
- **Dynamic AI Provider Selection:** The AI provider (OpenAI, Google, Ollama) can be selected via the `application.yaml` file.
- **Email Alert Generation:** The application can generate and save email alerts if errors are detected in the logs. The email content is generated by the LLM based on a template.
- **External Log Fetching:** The application can fetch logs from different environments (dev, test, acc, prd) based on URLs configured in `application.yaml`.
- **Configuration-Driven:** Environment-specific settings, such as log URLs and AI provider details, are managed through the `application.yaml` file using `@ConfigurationProperties`.
- **Mock Log Generation:** A utility class (`LogStreamGenerator`) is available to generate realistic, dynamic log data for testing purposes.
- **Output Storage:** The analysis results and generated email alerts are saved to the local file system in the `output` directory.

## Future Enhancements

1.  **Database Integration:** Store the full analysis results and metadata in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for historical tracking and trend analysis.
2.  **Web Interface:** Develop a user interface to:
    *   Display the AI-generated summary.
    *   Allow users to submit logs or trigger analysis.
    *   View historical analysis results.
3.  **Real-time Log Streaming:** Integrate with a real-time log streaming platform (e.g., Kafka, ELK) instead of fetching logs via REST API.
4.  **Enhanced Email Functionality:** Integrate with a mail server (e.g., using Spring's `JavaMailSender`) to send email alerts automatically instead of just saving them to a file.
5.  **Advanced Querying:** Allow users to provide more complex queries and filters for log analysis through the API or a future UI.
6.  **Containerization:** Provide a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application for easy deployment and scaling.
7.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
